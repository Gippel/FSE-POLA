This project is aiming at reimplementing the open functions with the princip of
least authotiry (POLA).
It consists of a minimalist shell (polash) that can executes commands using
the polalib for open calls, the polalib itself, and the pola-i command that is
interactive when choosing to allow or not reading/writing rights.

Make will compile the program and place the binaries files (polash and pola-i)
in the /bin folder. This one is present ine the environnment $PATH, so you can
either call directly the pola-i command, or call it from the polash shell.
